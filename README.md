# Data Scientist Professional with Python Projects

Welcome to my repository for the Data Scientist Professional with Python track on DataCamp! This repository contains the projects I've completed as part of my journey in mastering data science using Python.

## Project List

1. Investigating Netflix Movies and Guest Stars in The Office
   - [Project Link]([https://www.datacamp.com/projects/investigating-netflix-movies](https://github.com/khaled-elsaeed/DataCamp/tree/d28365d3f20c12881cab60c9e4f61f9935a68b5c/Investigating%20Netflix%20Movies%20and%20Guest%20Stars%20in%20The%20Office))

   - This project involved analyzing a dataset of Netflix movies using Python. I explored movie durations, countries of origin, and genre trends within the Netflix catalog. By 
      visualizing the data and drawing insights, I gained a better understanding of Netflix's movie offerings.
